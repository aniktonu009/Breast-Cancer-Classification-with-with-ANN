# Breast-Cancer-Classification-with-ANN

An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for breast cancer classification is a machine learning model designed to analyze features of breast cancer data and predict whether a given tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous). Here's a general description of an ANN for breast cancer classification:

## Architecture:
# Input Layer:

Nodes: One node for each feature in the dataset (e.g., characteristics of cell nuclei).
Purpose: Takes input features representing characteristics of tumors.
Hidden Layers:

Nodes: Multiple layers with varying numbers of nodes/neurons.
Purpose: Extracts and learns hierarchical representations from input features.
Output Layer:

Nodes: One node for binary classification (malignant or benign).
Activation Function: Typically sigmoid, representing the probability of the tumor being malignant.
Purpose: Produces the final prediction for the tumor class.
Training:
Loss Function:

sparse_categorical_crossentropy : is a loss function used in neural network models, especially for multi-class classification problems where the target labels are integers (class indices). This loss function is suitable when the target variable is not one-hot encoded, meaning each sample is assigned an integer label representing its class.
Optimizer:

Adam, SGD, or others: Optimizes the network's weights based on the chosen loss function.
Metrics:

Accuracy: Measures the model's accuracy on the training and validation sets.
Workflow:
Data Preprocessing:

standardize input features.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Compilation:

Define the neural network architecture.
Compile the model with appropriate loss function, optimizer, and metrics.
Model Training:

Train the model on the training set using backpropagation and gradient descent.
Evaluation:

Evaluate the model on the testing set to assess its generalization performance.
Interpretation:
Prediction:

Use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.
Thresholding:

Apply a threshold to convert predicted probabilities into binary class labels.
Performance Metrics:

Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
An ANN for breast cancer classification leverages the model's ability to learn complex patterns and relationships within the data to make accurate predictions about tumor malignancy. The choice of architecture and hyperparameters depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the requirements of the classification task.
